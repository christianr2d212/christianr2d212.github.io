## Ideas for Project Review

 

## Introduction
the *On Broadway* data project by Lev Manovich which analyzes data from a single street in NYC. It incorporates data like twitter, instagram posts, taxi pickups, and household income along a 13 mile stretch of a street. [Link to Project](http://www.on-broadway.nyc)
This project analyzes five datasets,  mapped around a single 13-mile stretch of a street in NYC. Data included is 2014 Twitter and Instagram posts, along with Foursquare check-ins, taxi pickups, and median household income. Google street view images of the are also added in the final project to situate what you're looking at. Overall the project intrepreted a lot of income inequality  reflected in the data. Often the south end of Broadway street was more affluent and carried more social media and taxi activity. The more north you got, the less activity on social media and taxi dropoffs. The end result is a massive interactive timeline, where a user can scroll (or touch) different parts of the timeline to show data for a specific block of Broadway St in NYC. You can lock at instagram photos of people in Harlem, or see how many taxi pickups go to places like Times Square or Columbia University, which are all on Broadway. There are  quick anecdotes and notes about where landmarks are to help guide and provide context for the data. This along with the separate data plots and visualizations are some of the project's biggest strength. It is possible to view data individually on its own dataset, or juxtaposed all together in the application. In total the application has 13 data layers based off the data! It also is suprisingly accessible, the application was made for large touch-screens for exhibits. For the most part, it still looks great on my laptop full-screen to communicate their argument. 

However, it feels like there could've been more elaboration on data, in particular the twitter and foursquare datasets. It would be great to hear an analysis on what businesses people checked-in to or what people were tweeting about. The project instead just lists how many check-ins or tweets were made per day similar to the instagram data. One aspect of their intrepretation of this data is that Broadway is like the city's human spine. But a data layer like the instagram photo colors doesn't communicate that message well compared to the layer on facade colors. There's also an added uncertainty that the data collected from social networks may not be entirely all the tweets or instagram photos from Broadway. Many users do not geolocate their accounts and socials, so there could be a lot of activity uncounted for. Despite these faults, the application for this data project runs well and is easy to navigate. The ease of accessibility could've been a reason why they couldn't make a data layer of tweets or foursquare check-ins.

Ultimately, the creators of *On Broadway* wanted to use data to visually represent New York. And also to figure out what percentage of instagram images of landmarks come from tourists! In the data project you see their argument that the whole city acts "as a kind of machine, if we examine different variables." With their data they made correlations that social inequality is actually represented in digital divides. Even with tourists the social inequality is prevelant, according to their data they only frequent famous landmarks and areas typically concentrated to the South of Manhattan. Their commentary on tourists is not included in the application itself. I think that speaks to their intended audience being anyone interested in looking at New York City through the lenses of data, images, and social media. The project has a section for the amount of exhibitions it has been in with places as far as the Netherlands exhibiting this project. That could potentially be why no criticism or argument about tourists was included in their project application.
