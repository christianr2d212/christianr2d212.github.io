## Ideas for Project Review

I'm thinking of reviewing the *On Broadway* data project by Lev Manovich which analyzes data from a single street in NYC. It incorporates data like twitter, instagram posts, taxi pickups, and household income along a 13 mile stretch of a street. [Link to Project](http://www.on-broadway.nyc)

## Introduction
This project analyzes around 5 types of data, all mapped and based around a single street in NYC. Data included is 2014 Twitter and Instagram posts, along with Foursquare check-ins, taxi pickups, and median household income. Overall the project intrepreted the fact that a lot of income inequality was reflected in the data. Often the south end of Broadway street was more affluent and carried more social media and taxi activity. The more north you got, the less images were shared.
